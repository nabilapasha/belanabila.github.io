       <p> <br> suffering </br>
        Don't know how long 
        the road that i have taken reaches the end 
        tired.... I feel tired
        the way i walk
        Maybe i should drive it well
        In order to arrive at the destination as you wish 
           
        but,can it be me?
        can the steering wheel collaborate with my thoughts?
        or is it the steering wheel that can lead me on 
        the right path?     

        God...is there someone you prepared for me to jointly 
        support this burden that i bear 
        So that i want to share my sadness
        I want to share my pain 

        Don't know what else i can do 
        i'm just a sinful woman 
        who wish you would show
        Forgiveness from you.
        </p>
